  <h1>A Letter To You</h1>
  <div class="letter">
    <p>Hello there Mrs.</p>

    <p>I know this isn’t the kind of thing you’d expect on your birthday. The cliché in modern society is men don’t know how to use their words. Well, I grew up watching you write and I read quite a decent bit so I’m a decent wordsmith. I’ll try to not dance around the point. I don’t know exactly what to call this. A message, a letter or a confession? It might be a blend of all, somewhere smack in the middle of it all. I’ll start from here.</p>

    <p>Today, you turn 27. Ridiculous. I remember it was just a couple years ago we were getting ready for school together. I had pissed off Mum and I should be taking some lashes and you offered to take 2 on my behalf. I think she really wanted to exercise her arms that day, ‘cause she gave you the two. And I was spared from taking 6 that early morning. It is etched in my memory and I will not be forgetting anytime soon. I’ve had a front seat to watch you grow to become the person you are. And my word, how much you’ve grown. From stealing my Cerelac as a baby to saying “Yes, I do” on the altar to a gentleman that looks at you with a glint in his eye. It was all so damn fast. You were my role model growing up. All of you were, but there was always some silent resilience in you that always had me wondering. I never told you, but I think you might’ve noticed that my handwriting is profiled from yours. Even the littlest of things like handwriting, I profiled from you. Imagine the bigger things.</p>

    <p>I desperately wanted to make a speech on your wedding day. Had it all written up, but it didn’t materialize so I’ve always been searching for alternatives to get that speech back to you. And today I felt it was a good time to let it fly. You’re settled to the normalcy of living as a married person and by the looks of it, you’re crushing it so far. It’s still a bit weird to see you going around with a ring on your finger but I reckon if you are used to it, it won’t be long till I also do. Thing is, in my speech I wanted to tell all the people that came to your wedding how much of a blessing you have been to me as a sister. How much I secretly thank God for putting you in my life.</p>

    <p>When Mum wasn’t around, you were my mum. Playmate, laughing mate and gist madam. You are the best of the best. And them random jollof rice, plantain pizza, Indomie and the rest, na heaven gate oo. The unders of the Tampico and whatnot. The way I look forward to them erh. Most of my core memories growing up are laced with the randomness you bring (whether it be tucking your lips in and punching me out of nowhere or pinching me without a cause). One of these days, in the near future, you’ll officially become a mum too. And although it’s also going to take quite a lot of time to get used to, there’s one thing I’m sure of and that is you’re going to be one of the best mothers the earth’s got. Apart from the little problem of you training the innocent child to abhor salads and onion, which I promise to counter when he makes vacation trips to Uncle, I have absolutely no doubts about it. And imma tell the child too, how much they’re blessed to call you their mum. Also, he/she MUST be a Sunday born (let that enter your head well).</p>

    <p>The whole idea of this is to tell you how much I love you, I’ve been blessed the past two decades and so (I would say 21 but I like fancy words) and you are a big part of my blessings. Maybe I might not say it too often because you will not allow me to forget it. If you tell anyone I wrote this, I will deny most parts. Back to business, I want to say thank you for putting up with me for the past few years since we met two decades ago. I am so damn proud of the person you’ve grown to become and the one you are yet to become. To your 27th chapter, may it be the dandiest and the grandest the world has ever seen. Filled with love, peace of mind, laughter, prosperity, God’s favor and topped with just the amount of craziness you would like. I love you sis, happy birthday.</p>
